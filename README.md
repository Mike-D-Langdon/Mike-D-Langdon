### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Mike and I am a recent graduate (2022) for Cal State East Bay with a BS in Computer Science.  I am currently volunteering at Common Good, working with Ruby and RSpec, trying to help out an association working towards making a positive impact on society.  My interests besides programming include mathematics, hiking in the mountains, and making music.  
Here are some of the technologies I've used:
