### Oh Hello
I didn't see you there.  My name is Mike and I am a graduate for Cal State East Bay with a BS in Computer Science (2022).   
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a delay VST.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the JUCE framework for writing audio plugins in C++.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m interested in music, math, mountains, and metal.  And movies.  Horror movies.
